### method
```css
flex-basis: calc(calc(8em - 100%) * 1024);
```

- __row__: Use this class for every container with responsive items in it.
- __col-xs__, __col-s__, __col-m__, __col-l__, __col-xl__: Use this classes inside a _row_ to define different sized entries.
- A _col_ can also be a _row_ for new columns.

Although this method is not as exact as a grid layout would be, it produces really interesting results and might be an alternative for non-grid-fallback support.
